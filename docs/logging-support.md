# Tekton Results Logging Support

## Overview

Tekton Results supports fetching logs from third party logging APIs.

To enable the logging API, in the results-api-configmap set `LOGS_API` to `true` and
and `LOGS_TYPE` to the provider type (see below).

## Loki

At present, we only support Loki as a third party logging API.

The following environment variables are required:

- `LOGS_TYPE`: Set to `Loki` to enable the fetching of logs from Loki.

## Common Configuration

These are the common configuration options for all third party logging APIs.

- `LOGS_API`: Set to `true` to enable the Logs API.
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_API_URL`: The URL of the third party logging API.
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_TOKEN_PATH`: The path to the file containing the API token. (optional)
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_KEY`: The key to use for the namespace filtering.
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_STATIC_LABELS`: The static labels to use for the logs.
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_PROXY_PATH`: The path to the proxy to use for the third party logging API. (optional)
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_CA_CERT`: The CA certificate to use for the third party logging API. This should ideally be passed as environment variable in the deployment spec of the results-api pod. (optional)
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_TLS_VERIFICATION_DISABLE`: Set to `true` to disable TLS verification for the third party logging API. (optional)
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_FORWARDER_DELAY_DURATION`: This is the max duration in minutes taken by third party logging system to forward and store the logs after completion of taskrun and pipelinerun. This is used to search between start time of runs and completion plus buffer duration.
- `LOGGING_PLUGIN_QUERY_LIMIT`: Sets the query limit for Third Party Logging API if logging backend has a limit on number of log lines returned.
