  title: Tekton Results API Specification
  version: v1alpha2
  description: >-
    Tekton Results aims to help users logically group CI/CD workload history and
    separate out long term result storage away from the Pipeline controller.
    This allows you to:

    * Provide custom Result metadata about your CI/CD workflows not available in
    the Tekton TaskRun/PipelineRun CRDs (for example: post-run actions)

    * Group related workloads together (e.g. bundle related TaskRuns and
    PipelineRuns into a single unit)

    * Make long-term result history independent of the Pipeline CRD controller,
    letting you free up etcd resources for Run execution.

      Records are individual instances of data. These will commonly be execution
      data (e.g. PipelineRun, TaskRuns, Logs), but could also reference
      additional data about the event/execution. Records are intended to be
      flexible to support arbitrary information tools want to provide around a
      CI event.

    description: >
      Results are aggregators of Records, allowing users to refer to groups of
      Records as a single entity. For example, you might have a single Result
      that groups the following Records:


      * Source Event (e.g. pull request, push) that kicked off the action.

      * The PipelineRun that occurred.
       * The TaskRuns that occurred in response of the PipelineRun (one per Task).
       * Receipt of Cloud Event delivery.
       * Receipt of Source status update.
